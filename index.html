          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            The art of theatre, it seems, is something innate to the human
            experience. From long lost tales of a hunt told by firelight by
            early humans thousands of year ago to the imaginative theatre of a
            child letting you know your card declined at their fisher price play
            kitchen, humans cannot help but engage in imitation. This imitation,
            or as Aristotle called it, <em>mimesis</em>, is at the heart of the
            <em>Poetics</em>, one of the earliest works of literary criticism we
            have documented. As Aristotle says, "two causes seem likely to have
            given rise to the art of poetry, both of them natural" namely
            "Imitation" along with "melody and rhythm" (<em>Poetics</em>, 3.1).
            Like any good philosopher, Aristotle's inclination upon recognizing
            the innateness of mimesis is to ask, why? Why do humans universally
            craft up imitations of events both real and fictional? and,
            furthermore, what is the essence of a truly great imitation?
          </p>

          <!-- The Poetics - general summary -->
          <h2>The Poetics</h2>
          <p>
            Before we can consider Aristotle's arguments for what makes the
            imitative art good, we must investigate what Aristotle has to say
            about the essence, or the ousia, of the Poetics to begin with.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the Poetics, Aristotle employs his usual method of categorization
            by establishing a genus, the Poetics, and some of its species,
            Tragedy, Comedy, and Epic. In the Poetics, Aristotle spends the vast
            majority of it investigating tragedy and its essence, and so we
            shall focus on that as well. Aristotle continues on with tragedy to
            establish it as "an imitation of an action that is admirable,
            complete and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each
            of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors,
            not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the
            purification of such emotions" (Poetics, 4.1). For Aristotle,
            Tragedy is defined through its effect of a purification of "fear and
            pity" as well as its constituent parts: "each of its species
            separated in different parts" (Poetics, 4.1).
          </p>

          <p>
            In effect, Aristotle lays out the essence of tragedy with respect to
            his established causal ontology: the "purification of such emotions"
            or the "achieving of katharsis" as it is frequently put, is being
            asserted as the final cause of tragedy. It's constituent parts, then
            are the formal cause. From another angle, one can also understand
            Aristotle's explanation on that nature of tragedy as being, as
            Martha Husain puts it in
            <em
              >Ontology and the Art of Tragedy: An Approach to Aristotle's
              Poetics</em
            >
            "" tragedy is generically a mimesis 2, differentiated into a
            specific nature, a tragike mimesis, by the three types of
            differentiae: the object of imitation (<em>praxeos</em>), the
            material of imitation (<em>logoi</em>), the manner of imitation (<em
              >di' dronton</em
            >)"" (Husain)
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, with respect to the constituent parts of tragedy that
            Aristotle mentions, he enumerates a comprehensive list: "plot,
            character, diction, reasoning, spectacle and lyric poetry" (Poetics,
            4.1). He then goes on to rank this list with respect to the parts
            importance as being first the plot, then character, reasoning,
            diction, lyric poetry, and lastly spectacle.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, we have Aristotle's assertions on the essence of
            tragedy. It is a mimesis in the medium of lyric poetry that evokes
            fear and pity in the audience for the purpose of achieving
            katharsis—it's final cause—and is constituted of six constituent
            parts—the formal cause—these being, in order of importance, plot,
            character, reasoning, diction, lyric poetry, and spectacle.
          </p>

          <!-- What makes a "good" tragedy? -->
          <h2>What makes a "good" tragedy?</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to explaining what he considers tragedy to be, Aristotle
            spends much of the work detailing what exactly he considers to make
            a tragedy "good" (which, within the framework of Aristotle's causal
            ontology, is an argument as to what qualities make a tragedy best
            serve its final cause of katharsis).
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Aristotle, a tragedy must have a few qualities to be
            considered good. To begin, a tragedy must have a plot which is
            "complex rather than simple" (Poetics, 7.2) by which he means "one
            in which the change of fortune involves reversal or recognition or
            both" (Poetics, 6.2). Furthermore, the best kind of tragic plot
            should concern someone who is an "intermediate" between one who is a
            "decent" man and one who is "depraved;" it should be the "sort of
            person who is not outstanding in moral excellence or justice" so
            that the audience can feel fear and pity for the events that happen
            to them but yet not feel "disgust" (Poetics, 7.2). Additionally, the
            plot must concern events which "appear terrible or pitiable"
            (Poetics, 7.3) and, according to Aristotle, this is best done
            through "interactions between people who are closely connected with
            each other" rather than "between enemies" or "between neutrals"
            (Poetics, 7.4).
          </p>

          <p>
            In regard to character, Aristotle says that character should
            consider, in order,
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>"goodness" - i.e. actions that result from moral choices</li>
            <li>
              "appropriateness" - i.e., whether a character fulfills their
              socially prescribed role
            </li>
            <li>
              "likeness" - i.e., acting in a way that seems believable of a real
              person
            </li>
            <li>
              "consistency" - i.e., not contradicting their characterization
              elsewhere in the work
            </li>
          </ol>

          <!-- Evaluating Aristotle's literary framework -->
          <h2>Evaluating Aristotle's literary framework</h2>
          <p>
            Given Aristotle's confidence in asserting what definitively makes a
            tragedy "good," it seems natural to me to ask the following
            question: has Aristotle's Poetics stood the test of time?
            Essentially, after over two thousand years since Aristotle laid out
            his definitions for what "the best kind of tragedy," is it still
            true that the best tragic stories follow along with Aristotle's
            format?
          </p>

          <p>
            In my view, I find that Aristotle's framework has a major flaw in
            its evaluative criteria: the idea that plot is the most important
            element of a tragedy. Under Aristotle's framework for causality, he
            argues achieving katharsis is the final cause of tragedy. Katharsis,
            however, comes from tragedy more from our relation to characters and
            our empathy with those characters than on the events that the
            characters engage with or create. Because of this, character, not
            plot, should be ranked as the most important feature of tragedy.
            Furthermore, I find that Aristotle's dismissal on the relevance of
            actors to acheiving the goal of katharsis is likewise shortsighted
            as the capacity for an audience to buy into a narrative (and thus to
            engage closely with the events that Aristotle claims are primary
            toward the final cause of tragedy) is intimately dependent on how
            well executed every constituent part of tragedy is, not just plot.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in order to fully explore whether Aristotle's Poetics are
            still relevant for evaluating tragic narratives, one can look toward
            a play that Aristotle cites frequently in the arguments of the
            Poetics:
            <em>Oedipus</em>
          </p>

          <!-- Aristotle's Poetics and Oedipus -->
          <h2>Aristotle's Poetics and Oedipus</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout the Poetics, Aristotle uses Sophocles' tragedy,
            <em>Oedipus,</em> as the golden standard for examples of what a
            tragedy which implements his ideas of the "best kind of tragedy,"
            and yet this very play is a shining example of why character, not
            plot, should be considered the most important aspect of tragedy.
          </p>

          <p>
            The character development of <em>Oedipus</em> is a central source of
            the play's ultimate katharsis. Throughout the play, the audience
            watches his fall from a well-respected king to a tragic figure who
            is oblivious to the truth about his own identity. Consider, for
            example, the scene in which Oedipus confronts Jocasta about his true
            identity. This scene is one of the emotional heights of the play as
            the audience watches Oedipus come to the realization that he has
            unwittingly fulfilled the prophecies of killing his own father and
            being wed to his mother. As Aristotle framework would suggest, the
            "pity and fear" felt throughout this scene is due to the events that
            have taken place, but this would be a flawed analysis. Imagine if
            Oedipus, at both at discovering his fulfillment of his fate and at
            his journey up to this point, was blank-faced and uncaring. The
            lines would be said the same, the events would transpire just as
            they had, and yet there would be limited if any katharsis to be
            achieved through this scene because the emotional weight of this
            scene doesn't come from Oedipus learning that his fate was sealed—it
            comes from Oedipus' internal turmoil and our empathy towards it.

          <!-- Final Thoughts -->
          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            As something unmistakably and universally human, the art of
            storytelling and imitation gives insight into philosophy of the
            human mind, emotions, and for Aristotle, the philosophy of defining
            its essence. While Aristotle's Poetics does much right in defining
            the essence of a tragedy, and in describing what exactly makes one
            the "best kind," it can be seen clearly through both great plays of
            his time, and of times after, that Aristotle's argument for the
            primacy of plot in tragedy is flawed. If it is true that katharsis
            is the goal of a tragedy, then character, not plot, must be
            considered its most important aspect.
